# RC-and-RLC-Circuit-Analysis

This is an experimental analysis mission of experimental engineering class.
The purpose is to solve RC and RLC circuits' differential equaitons both analytically and numerically.Then we compare them with experimental data in terms of performance, settling time etc.

Download the data in .mat format to your desktop and open them with MATLAB. Then name them as "RC" or "RLC". Run the code and enjoy the graphs. 
Note: Differential equations are in the report.
